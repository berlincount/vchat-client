Hi!

this is vchat-client, a GPLed (SSL) client for the vchat protocol.

You can get the most recent version of vchat-client via git, e.g:

git clone git://erdgeist.org/vchat-client

(press return at password prompt)

no autoconf yet, sorry. required libs:

openssl (1.0.1g+ preferred)
readline (4.2+ preferred)
ncurses (5.2 preferred)

please adjust the Makefile according to your need, then run 'make' to compile,
./vchat-client to start the binary. nope, I don't have any intention to use
autoconf for this hack.

run 'fakeroot make -f debian/rules binary' to build a debian package from the
source.

Keyboard commands:

^J  - clear private window
^O  - clear channel window
^L  - redraw screen
^F  - scroll window up
^B  - scroll window down
^R  - change active scrolling window
      (see rightmost character of topic/console lines)
^T  - shrink private window size
^G  - grow private window size
^X  - toggle private window
      (pops up on private messages)
TAB - nick completion

We also do provide a set of IRC like / - commands, there are:

/CONFIG              - not implemented yet, but will be used for configuration
/QUIT       reason   - issue .x reason
/USER       regex    - list users matching regex
/FLT    C   regex    - add regex to filter list... read ./filters for details
/RMFLT      regex|id - remove filter regex or id from filter list
/LSFLT (C)           - list all filter rules (matching C)
/CLFLT (C)           - remove all filter rules (matching C)
/M(SG) user msg      - issue .m user msg
/LH                  - print hilitelist
/ME action           - issue .a action

if you want to use an own window for messages set "messages" to a value in
~./vchat/config ..

if you want to use an SSL certificate with the default configuration you need
to put the key in ~/.vchat/key and the certificate in ~/.vchat/cert, both in
PEM format. You can generate a key and a certificate by calling vchat-keygen,
but the server you connect needs to know the anon CA provided by vchat-keygen,
which currently isn't the case anywhere.
