vchat-client now offers a new model of shaping your messages:
Filters.

Filters can have different colours, where [0-9] stand for
colour pairs, certain letters of [a-zA-Z] mean character
attributes. The two "special colours" [+-] are used for
black/whitelisting your messages, from now on called
ignore/zoom.

While the alphanumeric colours are used to highlight the
regex associated with them, the latter case may be used
to select some of the messages from your scrollback buffer.

This may mean - regex "all but those messages containing
the regex" or + regex "only those messages containing the
regex".

When you have ignore regexes, zooming always supersedes
ignorance, i.e. a message that once is declared as white-
listed wont be ignored.
